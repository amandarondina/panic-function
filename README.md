# panic-function
This is a part of last year's JavaScriptmas, a free annual festive coding event hosted by the online coding school Scrimba.
I decided to use the challanges as inspiration for simple coding projects.



## Day 1 
 >Write a PANIC function. The function should take in a sentence and return the same sentence in all caps with an exclamation point (!) at the end.
Use JavaScript's built-in string methods. If the string is a phrase or sentence, add a ðŸ˜± emoji in between each word.
